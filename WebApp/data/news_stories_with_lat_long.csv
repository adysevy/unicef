The dead, including a seven-year-old girl and her baby sister, were Ahmadis. A 1984 Pakistani law declared them non-Muslims and many Pakistanis consider them heretics. Police said that the violence in the town of Gujranwala, 220 km southeast of Islamabad, started with an altercation between young men, one of whom was an Ahmadi accused of posting ""objectionable material"". ""Later, a crowd of 150 people came to the police station demanding the registration of a blasphemy case against the accused,"" said one police officer who declined to be identified. ""As police were negotiating with the crowd, another mob attacked and started burning the houses of Ahmadis."" The youth accused of making the Facebook post had not been injured, he said. A spokesperson for the Ahmadi community, said it was the worst attack on the community since simultaneous attacks on Ahmadi places of worship killed 86 Ahmadis four years ago. The police officer said they had tried to stop the mob.  Accusations of blasphemy are rocketing in Pakistan, from one in 2011 to at least 68 last year, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. About 100 people have been accused of blasphemy this year. Human rights workers say the accusations are increasingly used to settle personal vendettas or to grab the property of the accused.","Mob kills woman, girls, over 'blasphemous' Facebook post",pakistan,"Mob kills woman, girls, over 'blasphemous' Facebook post",Reuters - http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/uk-pakistan-islam-murder-idUKKBN0FX0GM20140728,30.375321,69.345116,disaster
