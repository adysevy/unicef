A lot of improvements have been made, but they are very precarious, Benoit De Gryse, head of MSF in Afghanistan said. If donors cut funding after the troops leave, healthcare is likely to worsen quickly too, he said. About 90% of the governments entire budget is funded by donors, so any cuts to that are likely to result in the government charging patients, closing district clinics and losing staff to a private sector which is completely unregulated, he said. The worst-case scenario is that everything that was built gets lost, he said. That would mean fewer vaccinations, more outbreaks of measles and polio, and a return to the very high levels of maternal deaths of the early 2000s.",Country risks losing health gains made in the last decade
